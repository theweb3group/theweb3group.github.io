## Versioning

Anytime the project is changed, no matter how small, the version needs to be updated.

Version Numbers:
 - A completed release uses whole numbers (e.g. "1" and "v1").
 - A work in progress uses numbers with decimals, and the prefix "WIP". The whole number indicates the release it's built from. The decimal indicates the save number (e.g. "WIP0.0" and "vWIP0.0").
